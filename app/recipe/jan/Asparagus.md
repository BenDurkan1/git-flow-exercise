# Aparagus

My husband used to not like pancakes and absolutely hate pancake syrup until I had him try the oatmeal pancake with mango or blueberry sauce. Now he regularly asks me to make some for breakfast. Serve warm with your favorite syrup or sauce.

## Ingredients

1 cup milk

⅔ cup quick-cooking oats

⅔ cup all-purpose flour

2 tablespoons brown sugar

1 ½ teaspoons baking powder

½ teaspoon salt

¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon

2 eggs

2 teaspoons butter, melted

½ teaspoon vanilla extract

¼ cup milk, or more as needed

2 teaspoons butter, or as needed

# Instructions

Break off or trim the woody ends from the asparagus and discard. Set the spears aside.

Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the pine nuts, cranberries, and salt. Cook and stir until the pine nuts start to look translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the asparagus spears and cook, adding a little more olive oil if needed, until stalks are bright green and tender, about 5 to 8 minutes. Serve on a platter with the cranberries and nuts spooned over the top of the asparagus.
